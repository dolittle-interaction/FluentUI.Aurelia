    <example-card title="Link">
        <p>
            When a link has an href,{' '}
            <link href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">it renders as an anchor tag.</link> Without an
            href,{' '}
            <link>the link is rendered as a button</link>. You can also use the disabled attribute to create a{' '}
            <link disabled={true} href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">
            disabled link.
            </link>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not recommended to use Links with imgs because Links are meant to render textual inline content.
            Buttons
            are inline-block or in the case of imgs, block. However, it is possible to create a linked image button by
            making a button with an unstyled variant and adding the img content and href source to that.
