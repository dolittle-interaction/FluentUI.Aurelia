        When a link has an href,{' '}
        <link href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">it renders as an anchor tag.</link> Without an
        href,{' '}
        <link>the link is rendered as a button</link>. You can also use the disabled attribute to create a{' '}
        <link disabled={true} href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">
        disabled link.
        </link>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not recommended to use Links with imgs because Links are meant to render textual inline content.
        Buttons
        are inline-block or in the case of imgs, block. However, it is possible to create a linked image button by
        making a button with an unstyled variant and adding the img content and href source to that.
